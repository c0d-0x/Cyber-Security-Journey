## Report Writing and Debriefing

A report is very crucial part of pen-test and is usually delivered within a week after the Engagement
on a pen-test. It usually involve an Executive summary for the non Technical people and a Technical finding section for the technical people, eg; system engineers so on...

A debrief on the other hand is a walk through of the technical findings of the report. It should brief and
specific to audience; that is non technical walk trough of the non technical people and a detailed technical walk through for the techies.
