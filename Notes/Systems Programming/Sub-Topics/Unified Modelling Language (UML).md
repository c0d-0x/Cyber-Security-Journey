UML, which stands for Unified Modelling Language, is a standardised way to visually represent a software system's design. It's not a programming language itself, but rather a set of symbols and rules for creating diagrams that depict the structure, behaviour, and different parts of a software system.

Think of UML diagrams as blueprints for software, similar to how architects use blueprints to plan buildings. UML helps software developers and other stakeholders involved in a project have a shared understanding of the system's design.
