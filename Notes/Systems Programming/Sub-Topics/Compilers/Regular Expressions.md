A **regular expression (RE)** (or **regular expression in automata theory**, abbreviated as **REs**) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Regular expressions are used to match strings in text and are especially important in lexical analysis and string pattern matching. They define **regular languages**, which can be recognised by finite automata.

### Rules in Constructing a Valid Regular Expression (RE)

1. **Basic Symbols**:
   - **Literal symbols**: Any single character (e.g., `a`, `b`, `1`) can be a valid RE by itself, matching only itself in the language.

  - **Empty string (ε)**: Denoted by ε, it represents the empty string and is a valid RE.
   - **Empty set (∅)**: Represents an empty set and matches no string.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Concatenation**: If `R1` and `R2` are REs, then `R1R2` is also a valid RE that represents all strings formed by a string from `R1` followed by a string from `R2`. For example, if `R1 = a` and `R2 = b`, then `R1R2 = ab`.
   - **Union (OR)**: If `R1` and `R2` are REs, then `R1 | R2` is also a valid RE that represents all strings in either `R1` or `R2`. For example, if `R1 = a` and `R2 = b`, then `R1 | R2` represents `{a, b}`.
   - **Kleene Star (Closure)**: If `R` is a RE, then `R*` is also a valid RE, representing zero or more concatenations of strings from `R`. For example, if `R = a`, then `R*` represents `{ε, a, aa, aaa, ...}`.

3. **Precedence**:
   - **Kleene star (`*`)** has the highest precedence.
   - **Concatenation** has the next precedence.
   - **Union (`|`)** has the lowest precedence.
   
   To change precedence, parentheses can be used. For example, `(a | b)c*` means the union of `a` and `b`, followed by zero or more `c`s.

4. **Parentheses for Grouping**: Parentheses can be used to group expressions and change the default precedence. For example, in `(a | b)c`, the union operation is applied to `a` and `b`, and then concatenated with `c`.

### Regular Expression Algebra

The **algebra of regular expressions** provides a way to manipulate and simplify regular expressions using algebraic identities. Here are some core algebraic rules that hold for REs:

1. **Identity Laws**:
   - \( R | ∅ = R \): Union with the empty set gives back `R`.
   - \( R∅ = ∅ \): Concatenation with the empty set results in an empty set.
   - \( Rε = R \): Concatenation with the empty string `ε` leaves the expression unchanged.

2. **Idempotent Law**:
   - \( R | R = R \): Union of a regular expression with itself is the same as the regular expression.

3. **Commutative Law for Union**:
   - \( R1 | R2 = R2 | R1 \): The order of union does not matter.

4. **Associative Laws**:
   - \( (R1 | R2) | R3 = R1 | (R2 | R3) \): Union is associative.
   - \( (R1R2)R3 = R1(R2R3) \): Concatenation is associative.

5. **Distributive Laws**:
   - \( R1(R2 | R3) = R1R2 | R1R3 \): Concatenation distributes over union.
   - \( (R1 | R2)R3 = R1R3 | R2R3 \): Union distributes over concatenation.

6. **Kleene Star Laws**:
   - \( R** = R* \): Double application of the Kleene star is the same as a single Kleene star.
   - \( R | R* = R* \): Union of `R` with its Kleene star is equivalent to `R*`.
   - \( ε | R* = R* \): Union of the empty string with `R*` is just `R*`.

7. **Absorption Laws**:
   - \( R | (R R*) = R* \): Adding `R` to the Kleene star form of itself yields `R*`.
   - \( R* R* = R* \): Repeating the Kleene star does not change the language it represents.

8. **Simplification Rules**:
   - **Empty String and Star**: \( ε* = ε \), as the only string generated by repeatedly applying ε is ε itself.
   - **Empty Set and Star**: \( ∅* = ε \), since no string can be generated from an empty set, so the only possible outcome is ε.
